            <h2>Local Game Harvest</h2>
            <p>Local Game Harvest is the biggest event of the year hosted by non-profit organization Louisville Makes Games. I promoted the event through public relations efforts, including social media campaigns and organizing TV interviews with WHAS, Spectrum, and MetroTV. As the Communications Chair, I also served as the face of the organization during all live TV interviews to tell the organization's story.</p>

            <h2>Biscuit Belly Ad Campaign</h2>
            <p>I had the opportunity to work with the breakfast restaurant Biscuit Belly on an advertising campaign to promote upcoming store locations in new markets. I had a blast learning the visual style of the brand and coming up with new creative elements, and the ads I created have been used on Instagram and Facebook to promote new Biscuit Belly locations across three states.</p>
