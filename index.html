                <h2>Local Game Harvest</h2>
                <p>In the years I have been part of Louisville Makes Games, I have met the most talented, skilled, and driven people I know. Louisville Makes Games is a non-profit which aims to promote game creation in Louisville. I serve as the Communication Chair on the board of directors, and I had the honor to promote the biggest event in our ten year history; Local Game Harvest. Local Game Harvest is a yearly exhibition of games created by people in or around Louisville in which the public is invited to try these games and speak with their creators. I reached out to local news outlets and did interviews as the face of the organization on broadcasts from WHAS, Spectrum, and MetroTV. Local Game Harvest was a celebration of those driven and talented people who make video games just because its what they love to do. My job was to put players in front of those games, and I'm proud to say that with more than double the turnout of 2023, we succeeded.</p>

                <h2>Biscuit Belly Ad Campaign</h2>
                <p>What began as a class project turned into a series of ads run by Biscuit Belly across multiple social media platforms. After communicating with the client, we identified two goals: introduce the brand to consumers near newly opened locations, and position their new lunch offerings as a healthier option. After our presentation, the client asked to run our example ads on Facebook and Instagram that day. Ads often require revisions, but this experience shows that if you listen to the client's needs, you can get it right on the first try.<br /><br /><a href="biscuit_belly_ad_campaign.pdf" target="_blank">View Full Campaign</a></p>

                <h2>Hardcore Cottagecore Marketing</h2>
                <p>Louisville, Kentucky based game developer Two Scoop Games faced an incredibly crowded video game market with their 2024 release 'Hardcore Cottagecore'. With roughly 50 games releasing on Steam every day HCCC needed to stand out, while being familiar enough to appeal to its playerbase. By understanding the target audience of the game and our unique selling proposition, I created trailers and social media content, and conducted targetted influencer outreach resulting in significant coverage.<br /><br /><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753330/Hardcore_Cottagecore/" target="_blank">View Store Page</a></p>

                <h2>DRE Rebrand</h2>
                <p>DRE faces a unique challenge; after decades of business using the name DRE, they were bought and rebranded as Avante Medical Surgical in 2019. In 2024, the business is operating independently as DRE once again, and while the future looks brighter than ever, they face the uphill battle of reinventing their brand. A brand new logo would make them unrecognizable to past customers, and reusing the old logo could lead customers to believe they were looking at an outdated website. My goal was to create a logo that was immediately recognizable as the same DRE customers love, but unmistakably modernized.</p>

                <h2>Independent Video Game Development</h2>
                <p>Over the last several years, I've taught myself programming, art, animation, sound design, and various other disciplines necessary to create my own video games. To date, I have released 25 video games to <a href="https://galactical.itch.io/" target="_blank">my itch.io page</a>, and created trailers and development logs to promote them on YouTube. Video game development has always scratched my itch to try on a variety of hats creatively and technologically, and has allowed me to build my skills across various disciplines while expressing myself creatively.</p>
