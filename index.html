                <h2>Local Game Harvest</h2>
                <p>In the years I have been part of Louisville Makes Games, I have met the most talented, skilled, and driven people I know. Louisville Makes Games is a non-profit which aims to promote game creation in Louisville. I serve as the Communication Chair on the board of directors, and I had the honor to promote the biggest event in our ten year history; Local Game Harvest. Local Game Harvest is a yearly exhibition of games created by people in or around Louisville in which the public is invited to try these games and speak with their creators. I reached out to local news outlets and did interviews as the face of the organization on broadcasts from WHAS, Spectrum, and MetroTV. Local Game Harvest was a celebration of those driven and talented people who make video games just because its what they love to do. My job was to put players in front of those games, and I'm proud to say that with more than double the turnout of 2023, we succeeded.</p>

                <h2>Biscuit Belly Ad Campaign</h2>
                <p>What began as a class project became a series of advertisements used by Biscuit Belly to promote their new Chesapeake location across multiple social media platforms. I worked with my classmates to perform market research and compile our strategy into a comprehensive document. I created the ads seen here and within the document, which were used by Biscuit Belly to advertise on Instagram and Facebook. From creating these ads as well as visually styling the document, I learned a lot about how to speak in the voice of their brand. Maintaining their fun style, while adding twists to it that delighted Biscuit Belly's owners and customers.</p>

                <h2>DRE Rebrand</h2>
                <p>DRE faces a unique challenge in 2025; For most of the company's life, they were known by that name, until 2019 when they were bought and rebranded to Avante Medical Surgical. In 2024, they were bought once again and removed from the Avante umbrella, and are set to do business as DRE once again. Now, they must let their customers know that they are both still here, and returning to form. I designed an updated logo which closely resembles the original so as to be recognizable, but serves as a distinctly modern take. The banner below tells the story of the brand visually, and is being used in email campaigns to get customers up to speed and buying from DRE once again.</p>

                <h2>Independent Video Game Development</h2>
                <p>Over the last several years, I've taught myself programming, art, animation, sound design, and various other disciplines necessary to create my own video games. To date, I have released 25 video games to <a href="https://galactical.itch.io/" target="_blank">my itch.io page</a>, and created trailers and development logs to promote them on YouTube. Video game development has always scratched my itch to try on a variety of hats creatively and technologically, and has allowed me to build my skills across various disciplines while expressing myself creatively.</p>
