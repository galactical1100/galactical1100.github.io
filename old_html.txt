                <h2>Biscuit Belly Ad Campaign</h2>
                <p>What began as a class project turned into a series of ads run by Biscuit Belly across multiple social media platforms. After communicating with the client, we identified two goals: introduce the brand to consumers near newly opened locations, and position their new lunch offerings as a healthier option. After our presentation, the client asked to run our example ads on Facebook and Instagram that day. Ads often require revisions, but this experience shows that if you listen to the client's needs, you can get it right on the first try.</p>

                <h2>Hardcore Cottagecore Marketing</h2>
                <p>Louisville, Kentucky based game developer Two Scoop Games faced an incredibly crowded video game market with their 2024 release 'Hardcore Cottagecore'. With roughly 50 games releasing on Steam every day HCCC needed to stand out, while being familiar enough to appeal to its playerbase. By understanding the target audience of the game and our unique selling proposition, I created trailers and social media content, and conducted targetted influencer outreach resulting in significant coverage.</p>

                <h2>DRE Rebrand</h2>
                <p>DRE faces a unique challenge; after decades of business using the name DRE, they were bought and rebranded as Avante Medical Surgical in 2019. In 2024, the business is operating independently as DRE once again, and while the future looks brighter than ever, they face the uphill battle of reinventing their brand. A brand new logo would make them unrecognizable to past customers, and reusing the old logo could lead customers to believe they were looking at an outdated website. My goal was to create a logo that was immediately recognizable as the same DRE customers love, but unmistakably modernized.</p>
